            I'm a full-stack developer who has expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, React Native, Next.js, Redux (Toolkit), Zustand, RTK Query, TanStack Query, AG-Grid, Three.js, GSAP, Jest, React Testing Library, Express.js, NestJS, MySQL, Nginx and Git.
            Certainly HTML and CSS (SCSS) are included alongside Tailwind CSS, Material UI, Bootstrap, etc.
            Also I have expertise in Python. Sometimes using Python ends up implementing Neuroscience tasks with PsychoPy software. Also I use Python for web crawling, ethical hacking, financial tools, etc.
            In addition, I utilize Adobe Illustrator for graphic design such as logos, vectors, icons, etc. Surely, Adobe XD and Figma have been using for UIs.
            At the end, I analyze financial markets. I use different approaches to do so simultaneously. My favorite one is Elliott.
